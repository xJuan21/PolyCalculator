In order to complete this first Project, it was needed to complete the following strategies:
1.- Initialize:
	1.a A List of Terms (from the STL Library) that would work efficiently with the Term Class and its functions
	
	1.b A general method to print the elements inside of the list, which permits efectiveness during the management of Data.
	
	1.c A Menu with commands that would not only work with the Linked List (Accumulator), but it would also let the user be
	aware of the different options that program offers to make calculations.
	
	1.d The single implementation of a Class for the accumulator was not completely essential, but it helped to organize and understand ideas
	or solve future issues
	
2.- Special/Additional Steps:
	2.a It was essential to look at the documentation of the STL lists sicne it made my work a lot easier and 
	it also allowed me to find the correct methods to use in specific situations.
	
	2.b The use of nemiver (Debugger) to find errors or bugs that would compromise the program.
	
	2.c Using the keyword const relative to parameters, methods and return values.
	
<< Bugs that might appear during the execution of the Program >>

1.- At the time of deleting a specific piece of an element from the List, the "+" sign might stay, since it does not belong to the number being deleted.

Most of the work related to this project was based on having a good understanding of the structure of STL Lists, and the behaviour tha they have with
respect to spexific situations. The main focus was on iterating through the list to manage the data in a correct manner and make it as efficient as possible and
mainly focused on the time complexity of each process.
